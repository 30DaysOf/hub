# The #30DaysOf Hub

## Motivation

Technology moves fast. Keeping up can be hard if you don't have some kind of _structured_ learning paths and resources to keep you on track.

That was the philosophy behind the #30DaysOf projects that I started in 2021. You can learn more about the individual projects in the [README](https://github.com/30DaysOf) for this organization.

The goal of _this_ project is to create a _#30DaysOf Hub_ that can make it easier to discover, share, mix-and-match the content created in both existing projects, and in a few new solo #30Days initiatives I have in mind.


## Objectives

The #30Days Hub is a static website that will (initially) be hosted on GitHub Pages. My objectives are:
 - Use Docusaurus2 as the framework for the initial site
 - Integrate Playwright-based E2E tests to validate site behavior (and explore test-driven development)
 - Integrate auditing (with Lighthouse) to validate site performance, accessibility, and SEO needs.
 - Integrate progressive web apps functionality to support ability to use site offline, and potentially ship it in app stores.
 - Use GitHub Copilot, Codespaces and Actions tooling to automate and simplify my developer experience.
 - Explore custom React components and Docusaurus plugins to create a reusable and modular site design.


## Specification

 This section is to be updated with a list of the website features and targeted user stories that will be used for the test-driven development.

## Development

Initial setup uses the default Docusaurus2 setup.



Once the initial site is scaffolded, the /about route on the site should host a step-by-step tutorial showcasing how this site was built, with an emphasis on test-driven development.
